1 | BOFFO |/2d/boffo| http://www.boffo-ny.org/ |Graphic Designer | Ai, Id, Psd | For each of the 7 artists participating in the Fire Island Art Camp, I designed 4 posters and postcards to advertise the artist's lecture, two film screenings and residency performance. Each poster were hung around the boardwalk for a two week period and the postcards were distributed to all the households in the area.| http://www.boffo-ny.org/#pp2p17/archive http://www.boffo-ny.org/#pp0p5/gallery-index http://artforum.com/diary/id=48058 http://nyti.ms/2bHR6G8
2 | SHELLS |/2d/shells| Commissioned | Graphic Designer | 3d scanner, Psd | A pair of friends share a ritual of collecting and exchanging rocks, shells, twigs.. It is a way to share experiences in tangible form. The task was to unravel that story through the image of the shell, in which pictures of it's native habitat was embedded into the 3d scan of the gift. | https://goo.gl/maps/MbmKNQmBw3r
3 | SCREEN TALE |/2d/screentale| Academic | Site visit and documentation, Google Earth explorer | Rhino w/ vray, Google Earth, Autocad, Psd, Ai | A block south of the London Olympic Stadium rich in manufacturing history faces demolition. What happens to the idea of ‘place’ when heritage is wiped out? Google Earth becomes an important to tool to explore and track change over time, a mark of contemporary methodology in studying ‘site’. This new vision of site comes about through the captured moments of Google Street View where one views still frames of random pedestrian activities. Each frame transcends the time of its occurrence but to the Google scroller, it hints at the story of that neighborhood.  Therefore the intervention remains on-screen. The project accumulates past buildings onto the present, carving a new digital ground for them to relive past events. The software tools are the source of their recovery and also embed themselves in the images, as the project wouldn’t be able to exist without Illustrator, Photoshop, Rhino, and Google. | https://goo.gl/maps/83evMRzh2Tm https://goo.gl/maps/hM65aKoAiJU2 http://strandeast.com/#explore"
4 | PREP SCANS |/2d/prepscans| Academic | Designing and executing 3d scan techniques | 123d Catch, Rhino w/ vray, PSD | Four ordinary object of different textures, forms and volumes were 3d scanned in two different states: fixed and unfixed. In the latter state, the object was rotated while being captured by the software. The purpose was to reverse the process that produces a precise 3d scan in order to visualize movement. As a result the surface of the scan became a collage of the object’s fluctuation between static-motion. Each scanned result expressed this technique as a still moment even though the object was not still itself. This identified the Blind Spot, the site of untranslatability, the site of this Thesis Project. As the 3d scan transitioned from one 3d program to another, the surface of the scan deteriorated into a variety of visual interpretations. In order to identify each mistranslation, each state was captured and charted. A series generative drawings was executed in an analog method in order to understand how the mistranslation continued to progress. | null
